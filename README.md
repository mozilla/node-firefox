# node-firefox

*node.js modules for interacting with Firefox via the [DevTools](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools) [remote protocol](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Remote_Debugging_Protocol).*

## Some of our grand goals

* Simplify app development for Firefox OS--make it look more like "normal" app development by enabling developers to use tools like Gulp to do things such as deploying to the device.
* "Close the circle" with Cordova + Firefox OS and make it possible to run `cordova emulate` or `cordova deploy`.
* Provide a command line tool which is somewhat equivalent in features to [WebIDE](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Tools/WebIDE), for people who like typing more than clicking.
* Mega grand goal: control/debug any browser on the command line via DevTools via [Valence](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Tools/Valence).

## Current status

We're code reviewing and auditing the existing modules, and figuring out how to have them testable against a number of platforms (this includes both simulators and real, physical devices). We're using the [node-firefox-ports](https://github.com/mozilla/node-firefox-ports) module as the base to help us devise a framework that works well. For more details, you can ask [sole](https://github.com/sole/) or [tofumatt](https://github.com/tofumatt/) in `irc.mozilla.org` #apps.

### Supported platforms

Here's a very early-stages support matrix. Bear with us as we make more progress ;)

## Contributing

It's still early stages, but we'd love to get you onboard, so we wrote some [guidelines for contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## History

Based on early work on [node-fxos](https://github.com/nicola/node-fxos) by Nicola Greco.

### Dependencies

In `node-fxos`, these are the dependencies between other modules of the project (or related, like `firefox-client`):

```
fxos-deploy +--> fxos-connect +--> fx-ports ---> firefox-client
            |                 |
	        |                 +--> fxos-start +--> fx-ports
			|                                 |
			|                                 +--> firefox-client
			|                                 |
			|                                 +--> fxos-simulators
			|
	        |
	        +--> fxos-findapp +--> firefox-client
			                  |
							  +--> fxos-connect


fxos-simulators (no dependencies)


fxos-reloadcss +--> fxos-connect --> ^^^
               |

fxos-console +--> fxos-findapp --> ^^^
             |
